# Do-Golf-Predict

Welcome to my **Golf Project Collection**! üéâ This repository houses two exciting projects from my Informatics coursework, focusing on data science and machine learning using Python. Below, you'll find a detailed overview of each project, insights into the notebooks, and a link to a presentation that dives deeper into the projects.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Playground_PlayGolf.ipynb
This notebook is all about exploring a golf dataset and uncovering some interesting insights. üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here‚Äôs what you can expect:
- **Data Exploration**: Dive deep into the dataset, examining various features and understanding their distributions.
- **Data Visualization**: Use cool plots and charts to visualize the data and gain insights.
- **Basic Analysis**: Perform simple statistical analysis to draw initial conclusions about the dataset.

### 2. Golf_MLP(edited).ipynb
In this notebook, we take things up a notch by building a machine learning model to predict golf outcomes. üéØ Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Construct a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to make predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Test the model and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

## Presentation
For a more detailed explanation of these projects, check out my presentation on Canva [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGG5R_0J8Y/rtvdI8LFHIJlQydwlV53zA/view?utm_content=DAGG5R_0J8Y&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). In this presentation, I walk through the main aspects of each project, including the methods and results.

## Getting Started
To explore the notebooks on your own, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Do-Golf-Predict.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Do-Golf-Predict
   ```
4. **Install the required packages**:
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required Python packages using:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Open the notebooks**:
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the respective .ipynb files to start exploring.
